# Math 2315 Lab 1 - Top 10 CO2 Emitters Data Analysis

## Data
This lab uses a dataset describing greenhouse gas emission numbers from a collection of countries and country groupings given from 1750 to 2021. The source link is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv & the data was downloaded on 29 March 2023 from _Our World in Data_

## Data Processing
Steps were taken to refine the data given from _Our World in Data_. The steps taken were to remove entries that didn't relate to specific countries, and focus mostly on the top 10 emitters for CO2.

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to describe the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters and how they have changed over the last 50 years (1971-2020)

## Requirements
This lab is done using Python and multiple imported libraries. These libraries are: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and missingno

## Author
The author of this lab is myself, Oscar Montoya-Santamaria.

## Liscense
Anyone may access the materials to this lab.
