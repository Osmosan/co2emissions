# Math 2315 Lab 1 Description

## Data
This lab uses a dataset describing greenhouse gas emission numbers from a collection of countries and country groupings given from 1750 to 2021. The source link is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv & the data was downloaded on 29 March 2023 from _Our World in Data_

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to describe the emission levels of the current top 10 CO$_2$ emitters and how they have changed over the last 50 years (1971-2020)
